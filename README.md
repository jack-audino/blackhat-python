Code from "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz. The code contains comments with notes written in the book as well as my own.

This repository contains code from the book [Black Hat Python by Justin Seitz](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Hat-Python-Programming-Pentesters/dp/1593275900). As I have been reading it, I have been doing each example. As I have been following along, I have been writing in the explanations that Justin Seitz writes in his book, as well as some of my own. For the scripts in the book that I had difficulty getting to work, I wrote myself instructions on how to properly use them. I have been adding in these notes to help myself better understand the content of the book, as well as for future reference and for testing purposes. Another important note is that I have been referencing [EONRaider's repository](https://github.com/EONRaider/blackhat-python3) that has translated the code in this book to python 3, so that I can run the scripts on my own system. While these changes are relatively minor, I do believe that this user should be credited as well. All of the files that have been written by Justin Seitz himself can be found at [this link](http://www.nostarch.com/download/BHP-Code.zip) and will also be included in this repository in [/BHP-Code](https://github.com/jack-audino/blackhat-python/tree/master/BHP-Code) (note: that version of the code has not been modified to run on python 3).

*All code in this repository should be used for testing and educational purposes only, and I do not take credit for any of it.*
